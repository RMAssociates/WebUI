Dr. Methani has been treating patients for the last 16 years both as a general dentist and a Prosthodontist
providing treatment ranging from simple check ups to veneers to extensive full mouth rehabilitation and
maxillofacial prosthodontics. Throughout her extensive experience, her aim has been to provide the most
comfortable setting and the most gentle yet professional care possible, which led her to establishing
Leaside Village Dental.

Her passion for dentistry saw her completing her Master of Dental Surgery (Prosthodontics) degree with a Gold Medal
from Goa University and her Doctor of Dental Surgery Degree with honors from University of Toronto. Her attention to
detail and search for excellence in everything she does has led her to receiving multiple awards in the various fields
of dentistry. She has presented scientific papers in various prosthodontic
and implant related national conferences, including the World Congress on Prosthodontics.
      </p>
      <p>
She loves being able to make a difference in the lives of people and winning their trust with her honest, patient
empowerment through education approach. She is actively involved in numerous charitable campaigns, both as a generous
donor and a volunteer, that have allowed her to reach out to people in need outside of dentistry. She also enjoys
spending time with her family, playing with her little baby, travelling, camping and is an avid nature lover!
(No surprise her office is environment friendly in both build and function!)
