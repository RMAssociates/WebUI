    <p>
At Leaside Village Dental, we pride ourselves in providing highly individualized dental care.
We realize that the vast majority of patients have some form of dental anxiety. Hence, we ensure
that our patients can come in and enjoy our warm and friendly atmosphere, heat and massage dental
chairs, watch TV, or even use laughing gas if required to allay their fears; all while feeling good about
getting your dental treatment done in an environmentally conscious green office!

    <p>
            Our facility has been built to meet LEED standards and we are a completely digital office!
We use digital x-rays to reduce radiation exposure for our patients and intra-oral cameras
to educate our patients about their oral health. Call us to schedule a complimentary
facility tour today to know more about our practice and find out if it is right for you.
