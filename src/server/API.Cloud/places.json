The office and treatment rooms are so clean and it smells like a spa! I have always had a strong fear of going to the dentist, but after meeting Dr. Methani and her wonderful staff they have changed the way I see going to the dentist. She explained every detail of my mouth to me and all of my treatment options, not once did I feel pressured or nervous. I highly recommend Leaside Village Dental to anyone who is anxious in a dental clinic or just looking for a new dentist in general. Thank you so much for changing my mind about the dentist, I wish I could give 10 stars!",
